# Field History Tracking 

The Field History Tracking module enhances your Odoo experience by enabling the tracking of field changes.

**Before** 

The default Odoo system only supports tracking for selected fields. Users may need to monitor specific changes in the fields of their choice within their Odoo system.

**After**
 
To address this limitation, we designed the Field History Tracking module. This system lets users create customized settings, empowering them to track any field they deem essential.

## Manual

## Features

#### Field Type Differentiation
The rules in History Tracking are differentiated based on field type. This includes 'Fields' which represent types that are not 'one2many' or 'many2many', and 'Relation Fields' which stand for the rest.

#### Updated Value Emphasis
To enhance visibility, new and old values of updated fields are highlighted with different colors.
