# Default Dark Mode 

This documentation outlines the functionality to set dark mode as the default theme for specific users.

**Before** 

Originally, when a user changed the theme to dark mode and logged out, the next time they logged in, it would reset back to light mode.

**After**
 
This limitation is overcome by implementing programming changes that now allow users to set dark mode as their default theme.
