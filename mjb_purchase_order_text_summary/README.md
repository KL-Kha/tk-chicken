# Order Line Summary 

The Order Line Summary module is a tool to provide a clear, summarised display of purchase line in an order within Odoo, making the management process more efficient.

**Before** 

The main problem is that Odoo does not originally offer any functionality that can summarize the quantities in a purchase order.

**After**
 
The solution was the development of the Purchase Order Text Summary module. This module introduces a new feature to summarize quantities in purchase orders, resulting in better handled and more efficient management of purchases.
